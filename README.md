# OTO - "On Task, On Time"  

## Description  
Welcome to **OTO** (On Task, On Time), a simple and intuitive To-Do list website built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project marks the beginning of my journey into web development, where I focused on honing my frontend skills, primarily through hands-on practice without heavy reliance on AI.

### Features:
- **Landing Page**: A clean, welcoming interface for users to explore.
- **Login Page**: A basic login page to simulate user authentication (for frontend purposes).
- **Task List Functionality**: Users can view and interact with a simple to-do list (note: this is currently static and doesn't include full backend functionality).
  
This project primarily serves as a platform for me to practice **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to better understand how the different technologies work together to create user-friendly web applications. While the functionality is limited to the frontend at this stage, it serves as a valuable foundation for future updates, including adding more interactive features and integrating a backend.

### Future Enhancements:
- User authentication with actual login functionality.
- Task CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with database integration.
- Mobile responsiveness for a better user experience.
- Option to set task reminders or deadlines.
