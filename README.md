# ToDoWeb  

## Description  
Hello! I am creating a simple ToDo website. It's called OTO. which means "On task, On time"  using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.**  
I started this project with minimal to no use of AI to practice web development in both frontend and backend.  

For the backend, I am still undecided on what to use, but I will update this README and document all changes in the CHANGELOG.
